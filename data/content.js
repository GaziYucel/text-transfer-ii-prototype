        The BMBF project OPTIMETA aims to strengthen the Open Access publishing system by connecting open
        citations and spatiotemporal metadata from open access journals with openly accessible data sources.
        For this purpose, we will extend Open Journal Systems (OJS) to give it functionalities for collecting
        and distributing open data by developing two OJS plugins for capturing citation networks and articles
        spatial and temporal properties as machine-readable and accessible metadata. We will ensure the target
        group-orientated design of the plugins by performing a comprehensive needs analysis for key stakeholders:
        the editors or operators of OA journals and the researchers, as authors and readers of articles.
        The developments will be designed and tested in cooperation with several independent journals
        and OA publishers. Overall, OPTIMETA supports the attraction of independent OA journals as publication
        venues by substantially improving the discoverability and visibility of OA publications through enrichment
        and interlinking of article metadata.`;

            <h5>Project description</h5>
            <p><strong>Objective of the project and addressing the purpose of the grant</strong></p>
            <p>OPTIMETA extends the well-known publication platform for open access journals, OJS,
            with citation and spatiotemporal data for each article and thus improves the OA ecosystem
            on the metadata side. Two OJS plugins enable a large number of OJS-based OA journals
            to innovatively link publications via a significant improvement in metadata richness,
            diversity and quality. This strengthens the perceived quality of the publications, significantly
            increases their discoverability and thereby increases the attraction of small and
            independent journals. Overall, the project will enable numerous small and independent OA
            journals to contribute to establishing OA as the standard of scientific publishing, to improve
            the propagation of OA publications and to lead the way in innovative cooperations, based
            on free and open source software and open data.</p>

            <p><strong>Methodological approach to achieve the objective</strong></p>
            <p>Various methods are combined to achieve the project's objectives. A mixed-methods
            approach will be used for the needs analysis. Expert interviews with editors and operators
            of small and independent journals, as well as researchers, will be used to identify key
            requirements for the design and features of OJS plugins. Later, a quantitative survey of
            these stakeholders will be conducted to determine their needs and priorities regarding the
            enrichment of article metadata with citation and geodata. These needs will then be
            formulated in user stories, on the basis of which the initial conception and the
            implementation of the two plugins will take place. In an iterative development process, a
            prototype will be made available to the community for testing and installation at selected
            cooperating partner journals*12 will be actively supported. The feedback received during
            webinars and short surveys will flow back into the next iteration of conception and
            development. The development will take place in joint agile sprints of the partners. At the
            end of each sprint stands the release of a minimum viable product (MVP). The export of
            the citation and spatiotemporal metadata to the respective target systems will then be
            implemented in cooperation with the stakeholders. Dissemination and community outreach,
            for example, on the project website (https://projects.tib.eu/optimeta), project partner blogs
            and social media (https://twitter.com/optmta), will begin with the first contacts in the course
            of the needs analysis and will accompany the entire project. We will maximise probability of
            a broad uptake of the project results and the practice is maximised through the high
            quantity and quality of productive interactions with stakeholders (Wolf et al. 2013) and the
            publication of all developed software and documentation under open licences.</p>
